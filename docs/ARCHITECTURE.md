# Architecture

Companion to `PRD.md`. Describes the target design. Where the current tree differs, `AUDIT.md` has the finding and `TODO.md` has the task.

## 2. Layering

```
route handler  →  service  →  repository  →  database
component      →  hook     →  route handler
```

Hard rules:
- A route handler never touches a repository directly. It validates input, calls one service, shapes the response.
- A component never imports a service. Server state arrives through a hook backed by TanStack Query.
- A repository never contains business logic — no thresholds, no alert decisions, no formatting.
- Only `lib/db/client.ts` constructs a connection.

Why: the scanner, the cron jobs, and the API all need the same device logic. If it lives in route handlers it gets duplicated, and the two copies drift.

## 3. Dependencies

Every dependency needs a justification line here. No line, no dependency.

| Package | Why |
|---|---|
| `next`, `react`, `react-dom` | Framework |
| `kysely` | Typed SQL for two dialects without a codegen binary |
| `mysql2` | MySQL driver; production |
| `better-sqlite3` | SQLite driver; development. Synchronous, which is fine for a dev DB |
| `@tanstack/react-query` | Server-state cache, refetch, invalidation |
| `zod` | One schema validates the API boundary and the form |
| `react-hook-form`, `@hookform/resolvers` | Forms, Zod-bound |
| `recharts` | Time-series charts |
| `framer-motion` | Page and list transitions (PRD §6.3) |
| `@radix-ui/*` | Accessible primitives under the UI components |
| `lucide-react` | Icons |
| `tailwindcss`, `clsx`, `class-variance-authority` | Styling and variants |
| `bcryptjs` | Password hashing |
| `node-cron` | Scheduled scans, aggregation, pruning |
| `oui-data` | Offline MAC vendor lookup — no network call per device |
| `pino` | Structured logging |
| `@fontsource/chakra-petch`, `@fontsource/ibm-plex-sans`, `@fontsource/jetbrains-mono` | Self-hosted fonts — no request to a font CDN, so nothing leaves the LAN and offline builds work |

Development only:

| Package | Why |
|---|---|
| `typescript`, `@types/*` | Type-checking |
| `jest`, `jest-environment-jsdom`, `@testing-library/*` | Unit, integration and component tests (`next/jest` provides the SWC transform, so no `ts-node`) |
| `@playwright/test` | E2E journeys |
| `tsx` | Runs the TypeScript CLI scripts (`setup`, `migrate`, `seed`, `bench`, `e2e-server`) without a build step |
| `cross-env` | Sets env vars in npm scripts on Windows too (`test:mysql`, `bench`) |
| `eslint`, `eslint-config-next` | Linting |
| `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, `autoprefixer` | CSS build |

`nodemailer` is not installed yet: password reset (F-64) is P2.

**Removed:** `@prisma/client`, `@prisma/extension-accelerate`, `prisma`, `pg` (PostgreSQL), `crypto` (dead placeholder — use `node:crypto`), `axios` (use `fetch`).

## 4. Data layer

### Why a query builder
The dual-dialect requirement is the whole problem. Raw SQL means maintaining two variants of every statement and discovering the divergence in production. A binary-engine ORM is unavailable (`MEMORY.md` §2). Kysely generates dialect-correct SQL from one typed definition and ships as plain JavaScript.

### Client — exactly one pool

```ts
// lib/db/client.ts
import { Kysely, MysqlDialect, SqliteDialect } from 'kysely'
import type { DB } from './schema'

const g = globalThis as unknown as { __db?: Kysely<DB> }

function create(): Kysely<DB> {
  if (process.env.DB_CLIENT === 'mysql') {
    const { createPool } = require('mysql2')
    return new Kysely<DB>({
      dialect: new MysqlDialect({
        pool: createPool({
          host: process.env.DB_HOST,
          port: Number(process.env.DB_PORT ?? 3306),
          user: process.env.DB_USER,
          password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
          database: process.env.DB_NAME,
          connectionLimit: 10,
          timezone: 'Z',
          dateStrings: true,        // DATETIME -> 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm', same as SQLite
          supportBigNumbers: true,
          bigNumberStrings: true,   // BIGINT -> string, never a JS bigint (AUDIT A-05)
        }),
      }),
    })
  }
  const Database = require('better-sqlite3')
  return new Kysely<DB>({
    dialect: new SqliteDialect({ database: new Database(process.env.DB_FILE ?? './data/dev.db') }),
  })
}

export const db = g.__db ?? create()
g.__db = db   // always — see below
```

The `globalThis` cache is not optional. Without it, Next.js dev hot-reload opens a new pool on every file save until MySQL refuses connections — the exact failure in `AUDIT.md` A-08. It is kept **in production too**: `instrumentation.ts` (the scheduler) and the route handlers are separate bundles, and a module-level singleton would give each its own pool and its own event bus. The shipped client (`lib/db/client.ts`) exposes `getDb()` lazily so `next build` never opens a connection.

### Dialect differences to respect

| Concern | MySQL | SQLite | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary key | `CHAR(36)` | `TEXT` | Generate UUIDv4 in application code. Never rely on auto-increment |
| Timestamps | `DATETIME(3)` | `TEXT` | Always write `'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm'` UTC (MySQL strict mode rejects `T…Z`); `mysql2` reads with `dateStrings: true`; convert at the repository edge (`lib/db/time.ts`) |
| `updatedAt` | `ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` | not supported | Set it in application code, both dialects |
| Big integers | `BIGINT` | `INTEGER` | Read as `string`, expose as `string` |
| Booleans | `TINYINT(1)` | `INTEGER` | Always write `0`/`1` (`better-sqlite3` cannot bind booleans); normalise to `boolean` in the repository |
| `UPSERT` | `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` | `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` | **Branch on the dialect**: Kysely's `onConflict()` emits `ON CONFLICT` only (MySQL rejects it); use `onDuplicateKeyUpdate()` for MySQL |
| Case sensitivity | collation-dependent | binary | Store MAC addresses uppercase, normalised at ingest |

### Migrations
Plain `.ts` files under `lib/db/migrations/`, run by Kysely's migrator through a **static provider** (imported, not discovered on disk, so they survive bundling), named `NNN_description.ts`, each with `up` and `down`. Dialect-specific column types come from `migrations/_helpers.ts`. Forward-only in production. Never edit a migration that has run anywhere — add a new one.

### Repositories
One file per aggregate: `deviceRepository.ts`, `bandwidthRepository.ts`, `connectionLogRepository.ts`, `categoryRepository.ts`, `alertRepository.ts`, `notificationRepository.ts`, `userRepository.ts` (users + sessions), `settingsRepository.ts`, `routerRepository.ts`, `networkRepository.ts`. Each exports plain functions taking and returning domain types from `lib/types/`. No framework types cross this boundary.

---

## 5. Scanners

```ts
// lib/services/scanners/types.ts
export interface DiscoveredDevice {
  macAddress: string        // uppercase, colon-separated
  ipAddress: string
  hostname?: string
  signalStrength?: number
}
export interface Scanner {
  readonly name: 'simulated' | 'arp' | 'asus'
  isAvailable(): Promise<boolean>
  scan(subnet: string): Promise<DiscoveredDevice[]>
}
```

Selection at startup, in order: the scanner named by `SCANNER_MODE` → `asus` if a router is configured and reachable → `arp` if `isAvailable()` passes → `simulated`. Each fallback logs a warning naming what failed and what it fell back to (PRD F-07).

`isAvailable()` for the ARP scanner is what prevents `AUDIT.md` A-16: it probes for the binary and for `CAP_NET_RAW` before the first scan, instead of failing on every cycle.

**Simulated data lives here and nowhere else.** A component calling `Math.random()` to fill a chart is a bug, not a placeholder (A-14).

---

## 6. Real-time updates

Server-Sent Events, not WebSockets.

```
app/api/events/route.ts   ReadableStream, text/event-stream, 30s keep-alive comment
lib/services/eventBus.ts  in-process emitter; scanner and alert engine publish
lib/hooks/useEventStream  EventSource subscriber; invalidates TanStack Query keys
```

Events: `device.connected`, `device.disconnected`, `device.updated`, `bandwidth.tick`, `alert.raised`, `scan.completed`. Internal-only events (`settings.changed`, `router.changed`) share the bus but are never forwarded to browsers.

The client does not render event payloads directly. An event invalidates a query key and TanStack refetches. One code path for data, whether it arrived by poll or by push.

Rationale for SSE over `ws`: one-directional is all the dashboard needs, it survives standard Node hosting and reverse proxies, it reconnects on its own, and it does not require a second server process. See `AUDIT.md` A-12.

---

## 7. Configuration

Root `.env.example`:

```bash
# Database — 'sqlite' (development) or 'mysql' (production)
DB_CLIENT=sqlite
DB_FILE=./data/dev.db

# MySQL — required when DB_CLIENT=mysql
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=home_monitor
DB_USER=monitor
DB_PASSWORD=

# Security — generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
SESSION_SECRET=
ENCRYPTION_KEY=          # 32 bytes hex, AES-256-GCM for router credentials

# Network
NETWORK_SUBNET=192.168.1.0/24
SCANNER_MODE=simulated   # simulated | arp | asus
SCAN_INTERVAL_SECONDS=30

# App
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
LOG_LEVEL=debug
AUTO_MIGRATE=true        # apply pending migrations at startup
SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true   # false on a second replica
# COOKIE_SECURE=true     # defaults to true in production; false only for plain-HTTP LANs
```

Validated once at startup by a Zod schema in `lib/config.ts`. A missing or malformed variable fails fast with a message naming it — never a runtime `undefined` three layers deep.

---

## 8. Security

**Router credentials.** AES-256-GCM. Store `iv:authTag:ciphertext` hex-joined in one column. Key from `ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Decrypt only inside the router service, at the moment of use. The password field is excluded from every serialiser — there is no API shape that includes it.

**Sessions.** Opaque random token (256 bit), stored as HMAC-SHA256 keyed by `SESSION_SECRET` in the `sessions` table. Cookie is httpOnly, sameSite=lax, secure in production. Sliding expiry, 7 days.

**Authorisation.** Middleware checks that a session cookie exists (it has no database access). Each route handler re-checks the role it requires. Middleware alone is not authorisation (PRD F-62).

**Input.** Zod at every route boundary. Parse, don't validate — the parsed object is what reaches the service, so an unvalidated field cannot leak through.

**Logging.** `pino` with a redaction list covering `password`, `token`, `secret`, `authorization`, `cookie`.

## 9. Performance

- Indexes per `DATABASE.md`; the composite `(device_id, timestamp)` on `bandwidth_metrics` carries every history query.
- Raw metrics are rolled into hourly aggregates nightly. History over 24h reads aggregates, not raw rows — this is what keeps the 30-day query under 1s.
- Retention pruning deletes raw rows past `dataRetentionDays` (PRD F-51). Without it the table grows ~2.6M rows/month at 10 devices (`AUDIT.md` A-17).
- TanStack Query `staleTime`: 5s for live metrics, 5 minutes for device metadata.
- Device table paginates server-side beyond 50 rows.
